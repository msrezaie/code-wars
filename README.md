# Code Wars - Code Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Code Wars katas. Each kata is a programming challenge that requires the implementation of a specific algorithm or solution.

## Kata Folder Structure
The katas are organized based on their ranking system on Code Wars, with each rank having its own folder. Within each rank folder, there are individual folders for each kata that I have completed, with the kata name as the folder name. Inside each kata folder, there is a solution file and a README file that explains the problem statement and my approach to solving it.
